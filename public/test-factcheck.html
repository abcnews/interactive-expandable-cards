  <p>The use of emergency powers during the COVID-19 pandemic — allowing governments to restrict individual freedoms, suspend constitutional norms and bypass normal parliamentary scrutiny — has prompted intense public debate across Australia.</p><p>A recent focus of debate in Victoria was the State Government's push to extend, from six months to 18 months, the maximum period a state of emergency can remain in force.</p><div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">

      </a></div><p> </p><p>Health Minister Jenny Mikakos declared a state of emergency across Victoria on March 16, 2020 to manage the spread of COVID-19, using powers under the <a href="https://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/in-force/acts/public-health-and-wellbeing-act-2008/043">Public Health and Wellbeing Act (2008)</a> — the principal act for public health powers in Victoria.</p><p>Once a state of emergency has been declared, the act gives the Chief Health Officer expansive powers to issue directions and take actions to manage risks to public health, such as the power to detain people, restrict their movement within the state and prevent anyone from entering Victoria. </p><p>Under section 198, a state of emergency can run for four weeks, after which it can be renewed for a further four weeks, up to a maximum period of six months. </p><p>Victoria is the only state or territory in Australia that caps the total time period during which a state of emergency can be in force.</p><p>The current state of emergency has been renewed a number of times but the maximum period of six months was due to expire on September 16, while stage 4 restrictions were still in place.</p><p>This is the reason the State Government sought to pass <a href="https://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/bills/public-health-and-wellbeing-amendment-state-emergency-extension-and-other-matters-bill-2020">an amendment to the Public Health and Wellbeing Act</a>: that is, to lengthen the total period over which a state of emergency declaration could continue for COVID-19.</p><p>It initially sought to expand the total to 18 months, but eventually compromised, agreeing to 12 months. The amendment has cleared the Upper House, paving the way for a one-off extension that relates only to the pandemic.</p><p>In other words, the total period during which a state of emergency declaration may remain in force in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Victoria will be lengthened from six months to 12 months.</p><p>The amendment will also enhance reporting requirements when a state of emergency declaration in respect of COVID-19 pandemic is extended beyond six months.</p><p>In Victoria, a state of disaster was also declared on August 2, under the <a href="https://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/in-force/acts/emergency-management-act-1986/048">Emergency Management Act 1986</a>, as Victoria entered stage 4 restrictions.
